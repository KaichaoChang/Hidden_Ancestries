# Hidden_Ancestries
Mainly iPython Notebooks for the Hidden Ancestries project overseen by Dr. Audrey Hendricks.

Dependencies include:
numpy
scipy (scipy.optimize minimize functionality)
timeit

The package is bloated with ipynb's which are mainly being used for development.
It is best to begin with running "Nonlinear Opt for Dr. Hendricks' Group 2 Ancestries.ipynb" 
which does not require anything besides the dependencies above and the HA main script.

Updates coming soon!
